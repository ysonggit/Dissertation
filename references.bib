  abstract     = {Coordinating multiple manipulators in a shared
                 workspace while considering their dynamics is an
                 important problem. This problem of collision-free
                 coordination arises in assembly, materials transfer,
                 and welding workcells. Previous approaches that
                 considered robot dynamics have typically been
                 restricted to coordinating just two or three
                 manipulators, even when their paths are specified. We
                 address the task of coordinating the motions of
                 multiple manipulators when either their trajectories
                 or their paths are given. By exploiting a fundamental
                 time scaling law for manipulators based on their
                 dynamics, we identify sufficient conditions for
                 collision-free coordination of the robots when the
                 velocity profiles can be uniformly time-scaled and the
                 robot start times can be varied. We describe an
                 approach that develops mixed integer programming
                 formulations of these problems, where the time scaling
                 factors are linear variables, to automatically
                 minimize completion time. This method can potentially
                 coordinate the motions of many manipulators.}

                 robots that can be employed in the harvesting of a
                 vineyard. We show that this prototyping method works
                 well and is appropriate for a system involving several
                 robots. We present the behaviors of each robot, their
                 interactions and some scenarios for the testing of the
                 system. Of specific interest is the cooperative
                 behavior of the robots in such a task. Preliminary
                 results indicate that some optimal choices toward the
                 development of the harvesting system can be correctly
                 identified based on these simulations. The choices can
                 then be used when designing and building the system

                 location $s$ to a target $t$ in an environment with
                 opaque obstacles that lie in its way. The robot always
                 knows its current absolute position and that of the
                 target. It does not, however, know the positions and
                 extents of the obstacles in advance; rather, it finds
                 out about obstacles as it encounters them. We compare
                 the distance walked by the robot in going from $s$ to
                 $t$ to the length of the shortest (obstacle-free) path
                 between $s$ and $t$ in the scene. We describe and
                 analyze robot strategies that minimize this ratio for
                 different kinds of scenes. In particular, we consider
                 the cases of rectangular obstacles aligned with the
                 axes, rectangular obstacles in more general
                 orientations, and wider classes of convex bodies both
                 in two and three dimensions. For many of these
                 situations, our algorithms are optimal up to constant
                 factors. We study scenes with nonconvex obstacles,
                 which are related to the study of maze traversal. We
                 also show scenes where randomized algorithms are
                 provably better than deterministic algorithms.},

                 achieving much faster convergence without good initial
                 (a priori) estimates of the position. The performance
                 of the method is illustrated both by simulation and on

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of exploring
                 an unknown environment with a team of robots. As in
                 singlerobot exploration the goal is to minimize the
                 overall exploration time. The key problem to be solved
                 in the context of multiple robots is to choose
                 appropriate target points for the individual robots so
                 that they simultaneously explore different regions of
                 the environment. We present an approach for the
                 coordination of multiple robots, which simultaneously
                 takes into account the cost of reaching a target point
                 and its utility. Whenever a target point is assigned
                 to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored
                 area visible from this target position is reduced. In
                 this way, different target locations are assigned to
                 the individual robots. We furthermore describe how our
                 algorithm can be extended to situations in which the
                 communication range of the robots is limited. Our
                 technique has been implemented and tested extensively
                 in real-world experiments and simulation runs. The
                 results demonstrate that our technique effectively
                 distributes the robots over the environment and allows
                 them to quickly accomplish their mission.},

                 hypotheses that can justify a separate implementation

                 in the extended space of poses x covariances; the
                 transitions between states are modeled through the use
                 of the Fisher information matrix. In this framework,
                 we consider two problems: minimizing the execution
                 time, and minimizing the final covariance, with an
                 upper bound on the execution time. Two correct and
                 complete algorithms are presented. The first is the
                 direct extension of classical graph-search algorithms
                 in the extended space. The second one is a
                 back-projection algorithm: uncertainty constraints are
                 propagated backward from the goal towards the start
                 state.}

                 The basic idea in the paper is to assign to each robot
                 in the team, a role that determines its actions during
                 the cooperation. The robots dynamically assume and
                 exchange roles in a synchronized manner in order to
                 perform the task successfully, adapting to unexpected
                 events in the environment. We model this mechanism
                 using a hybrid systems framework and apply it in
                 different cooperative tasks: cooperative manipulation
                 and cooperative search and transportation. Simulations

                 involved in distributing the task of transporting an
                 object over a group of homogeneous mobile robots. We
                 assume that each individual robot has no advanced
                 sensory or communication capability. The motion
                 control here refers to that of the robots to form some
                 geometric pattern before they start moving and to
                 maintain the geometric pattern while the robots are
                 moving towards a goal location. The motion control of
                 the robots is implemented in a distributed fashion. A
                 distributed, concurrent algorithm for forming
                 geometric patterns is discussed. Different control
                 methods are presented and the simulation results from
                 resting these methods are examined. The objective is
                 to study the complexity of motion coordination of the
                 robots in performing the overall task. The ultimate
                 goal is to identify a method that requires minimum
                 real-time inter-robot communication and computational
                 effort to achieve the group goal.},

                 set of Pareto-optimal coordination strategies for two
                 translating polygonal robots in the plane. A
                 collision-free acyclic roadmap of piecewise-linear
                 paths is given on which the two robots move. The
                 robots have a maximum speed and are capable of
                 instantly switching between any two arbitrary speeds.
                 Each robot would like to minimize its travel time
                 independently. The Pareto-optimal solutions are the
                 ones for which there exist no solutions that are
                 better for both robots. The algorithm computes exact
                 solutions in time O(mn<sup>2</sup> log n), in which m
                 is the number of paths in the roadmap, n is the number
                 of coordination space vertices. An implementation is
                 presented.}

                 explore and learn an unknown room with obstacles in
                 it. We seek algorithms that achieve a bounded ratio of
                 the worst-case distance traversed in order to see all
                 visible points of the environment (thus creating a
                 map), divided by the optimum distance needed to verify
                 the map, if we had it in the beginning. The situation
                 is complicated by the fact that the latter off-line
                 problem (the problem of optimally verifying a map) is
                 NP-hard. Although we show that there is no such
                 {"}competitive{"} algorithm for general obstacle
                 courses, we give a competitive algorithm for the case
                 of a polygonal room with a bounded number of obstacles
                 in it. We restrict ourselves to the rectilinear case,
                 where each side of the obstacles and the room is
                 parallel to one of the coordinates, and the robot must
                 also move either parallel or perpendicular to the
                 sides. (In a subsequent paper, we will discuss the
                 extension to polygons of general shapes.)},

                 desirable properties of swarm robotic systems, as
                 observed in the system-level functioning of social
                 insects, 2) proposing a definition for the term swarm
                 robotics, and putting forward a set of criteria that
                 can be used to distinguish swarm robotics research
                 from other multi-robot studies, 3) providing a review

                 inspiration, and a list of promising domains for the

  abstract     = {Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) are, nowadays, an important
                 research area within Robotics and Artificial
                 Intelligence and a growing number of systems has been
                 recently presented in the literature. Since
                 application domains and tasks that are faced by MRS
                 are of increasing complexity, the ability of the
                 robots to cooperate can be regarded as a fundamental
                 feature. In this paper, we present a survey of the
                 recent work in the area by specifically examining the
                 forms of cooperation and coordination realized in the
                 MRS. In particular, we propose a new taxonomy for
                 classification of the approaches to coordination in
                 MRS and we describe some systems, which we consider
                 representative in our taxonomy. We finally discuss the
                 outcomes of our analysis and try to highlight future
                 trends of the research on MRS.},

                 free paths for multiple robots subject to local
                 coordination constraints. More specifically, given a
                 set of robots, their initial and final configurations,
                 and possibly some additional coordination constraints,
                 our goal is to compute a collision-free path between
                 the initial and final configuration that maintains the
                 constraints. To solve this problem, our approach
                 generalizes the social potential field method to be
                 applicable to both convex and nonconvex polyhedra.
                 Social potential fields are then integrated into a
                 “physics-based motion planning” framework which
                 uses constrained dynamics to solve the motion planning
                 problem. Our approach is able to plan for over 200
                 robots while averaging about 110 ms per step in a
                 variety of environments.}

                 attaining a goal. Vector-valued (or Pareto) optima for

                 However, for cylindrical obstacles (those defined by
                 pairwise interactions), we prove a finite bound on the
                 number of optimal coordinations. For such systems, we
                 present an exact subquadratic algorithm for reducing a

                 representative.}

                 such as cliff faces and site construction operations
                 by autonomous robotic systems on Mars requires a
                 control architecture that is able to autonomously
                 adapt to uncertainties in knowledge of the envi-
                 ronment. We report on the development of a
                 software/hardware framework for cooperating multiple
                 robots performing such tightly coordinated tasks. This
                 work builds on our earlier research into autonomous
                 planetary rovers and robot arms. Here, we seek to
                 closely coordinate the mobility and manipulation of
                 multiple robots to perform examples of a cliff
                 traverse for science data acquisition, and site
                 construction operations including grasping, hoisting,
                 and transport of extended objects such as large array
                 sensors over natural, unpredictable terrain. In
                 support of this work we have developed an enabling
                 distributed control architec- ture called control
                 architecture for multirobot planetary outposts
                 (CAMPOUT) wherein integrated multirobot mobility and
                 control mechanisms are derived as group compositions
                 and coordination of more basic behaviors under a
                 task-level multiagent planner. CAMPOUT includes the
                 necessary group behaviors and com- munication
                 mechanisms for coordinated/cooperative control of
                 heterogeneous robotic platforms. In this paper, we
                 describe CAMPOUT, and its application to ongoing
                 physical experiments with multirobot systems at the
                 Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, for
                 exploration of cliff faces and deployment of extended
                 payloads.}

                 revisit the well-known visibility based
                 pursuit-evasion problem and show that, in contrast to
                 deterministic strategies, a single pursuer can locate
                 an unpredictable evader in any simplyconnected
                 polygonal environment using a randomized strategy. The
                 evader can be arbitrarily faster than the pursuer and
                 it may know the position of the pursuer at all times
                 but it does not have prior knowledge of the random
                 decisions made by the pursuer. Second, using the
                 randomized algorithm together with the solution of a
                 known lion and man problem [12] as subroutines, we
                 present a strategy for two pursuers (one of which is
                 at least as fast as the evader) to quickly capture an
                 evader in a simply-connected polygonal environment.},

  abstract     = {This thesis deals with all aspects of mobile robot
                 localization for indoor applications. The problems
                 span from tracking the position given an initial
                 estimate, over finding it without any prior position
                 knowledge, to automatically building a representation
                 of the environment while performing localization. The
                 theme is the use of minimalistic models which capture
                 the large scale structures of the environment, such as
                 the dominant walls, to provide scalable and
                 low-complexity solutions. In many cases it is enough
                 to only maintain an estimate of the robot position.
                 For such situation an extensively tested
                 low-complexity, robust and accurate pose tracking
                 method is presented which utilizes the minimalistic
                 model in combination with a laser sensor. When the
                 initial position is unknown the robot must perform
                 global localization. Two different methods are
                 investigated. The first one is a novel localization
                 scheme, based on the ideas of Multiple Hypothesis
                 Tracking. The second is an, experimentally verified,
                 significant improvement of the standard Monte Carlo
                 Localization technique. To automatically generate an
                 environmental representation an hierarchical approach
                 to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is
                 presented. The map scaling issue is here addressed by
                 dividing the environment into submaps, each
                 representing a small area.},

  abstract     = {(passive, local, probabilistic) Keeping track of the
                 position and orientation over time using sensor data,
                 i.e. \emph{pose tracking}, is a central component in
                 many mobile robot systems. In this paper we present a
                 Kalman filter based approach utilizing a minimalistic
                 environmental model. By continuously updating the
                 pose, matching the sensor data to the model is
                 straightforward and outliers can be filtered out
                 effectively by validation gates. The minimalistic
                 model paves the way for a low-complexity algorithm
                 with a high degree of robustness and accuracy.
                 Robustness here refers both to being able to track the
                 pose for a long time, but also handling changes and
                 clutter in the environment. This robustness is gained
                 by the minimalistic model only capturing the stable
                 and large scale features of the environment. The
                 effectiveness of the pose tracker will be demonstrated
                 through a number of experiments, including a run of 90
                 minutes which clearly establishes the robustness of
                 the method.},

                 environment, each robot constrained to move on a
                 roadmap in its configuration space. To program optimal
                 collision-free motions requires a choice of the
                 appropriate notion of optimality. We work in the case
                 where each robot wishes to travel to a goal while
                 optimizing elapsed time and consider vector-valued
                 (Pareto) optima. Earlier work demonstrated a finite
                 number of Pareto-optimal classes of motion plans when
                 the robots are subjected to velocity bounds but no
                 acceleration bounds. This paper demonstrates that when
                 velocity and acceleration are bounded, the finiteness
                 result still holds for certain systems, e.g., two
                 robots; however, in the general case, the acceleration
                 bounds can lead to continua of Pareto optima. We give
                 examples and explain the result in terms of the
                 geometry of phase space.}

                 architecture with a body force sensor. The body force
                 sensor is the force/torque sensor which is located
                 between the drive mechanism and the body of the mobile
                 robot. The use of the body force sensor almost
                 realizes the collocation of sensors and actuators, and
                 makes the whole body of the mobile robot sensitive to
                 external force/moment. Decentralized motion control
                 algorithm for handling a single object by multiple
                 robots in coordination is implemented in each mobile
                 robot and stable handling of an object is realized by
                 multiple mobile robots with the body force sensor.
                 Experimental results illustrate the validity of the
                 proposed architecture.}

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose an off-line and on-line
                 planning algorithm for cooperative tasks of multiple
                 mobile robots. Sweeping means a motion in which a
                 robot covers a 2-dimensional area with its effectors
                 (Fig..1). This task has variety of applications such
                 as floor sweeping, painting, and object exploring. The
                 former studies on this topic applied reactive planning
                 based only on sensor information. These approaches
                 have disadvantage of decreasing task efficiency
                 immediately as the shape of environment becomes
                 complicated. The planner proposed in this study has
                 two phases: the off-line planner generate the sweeping
                 trajectory based on environmental model, and the
                 on-line planner navigates robot’s motion that covers
                 the map errors and robot motion errors. As the
                 off-line planner, we introduce both edges of the
                 configuration space and Voronoi diagram so as to
                 compute paths in the whole area. Appropriate paths are
                 assigned to each robot by considering path length
                 (Fig.2）．As the on-line planner, we propose (a) an
                 algorithm in which a robot partially recognizes
                 unknown obstacles and re-constructs its path locally
                 by utilizing the stacker-crane problems in graph
                 theory(Fig.3), and (b) an algorithm that measures a
                 part of contour on the map while running along it; and
                 generate the motion with correcting the map and
                 adjusts the path(Fig.4). Experimental results with
                 holonomic robots show the effectiveness of the
                 proposed algorithm from the viewpoint of efficiency
                 and adaptability.},

  abstract     = {(passive, local) Open-loop position estimation
                 methods are commonly used in mobile robot
                 applications. Their strength lies in the speed and
                 simplicity with which an estimated position is
                 determined. However, these methods can lead to
                 inaccurate or unreliable estimates. Two position
                 estimation methods are developed in this paper, one
                 using a single optical flow sensor and a second using
                 two optical sensors. The first method can accurately
                 estimate position under ideal conditions and when
                 wheel slip perpendicular to the axis of the wheel
                 occurs. A second method can accurately estimate
                 position even when wheel slip parallel to the axis of
                 the wheel occurs. Location of the sensors is
                 investigated in order to minimize errors caused by
                 inaccurate sensor readings. Finally, the method is
                 implemented and tested using a mobile robot with
                 sensors. Estimates of position were found to be as
                 accurate as dead-reckoning in ideal conditions and
                 much more accurate in cases where wheel slip occurs.}

                 problem of mobile robot navigation in a known
                 environment is presented. An algorithm for,
                 model-based localization that relies on the concept of
                 a geometric beacon, a naturally occurring environment
                 feature that can be reliably observed in successive
                 sensor measurements and can be accurately described in
                 terms of a concise geometric parameterization, is
                 developed. The algorithm is based on an extended
                 Kalman filter that utilizes matches between observed
                 geometric beacons and an a priori map of beacon
                 locations. Two implementations of this navigation
                 algorithm, both of which use sonar, are described. The
                 first implementation uses a simple vehicle with point
                 kinematics equipped with a single rotating sonar. The
                 second implementation uses a `Robuter' mobile robot
                 and six static sonar transducers to provide
                 localization information while the vehicle moves at
                 typical speeds of 30 cm/s}

  abstract     = {A model of mobile robot navigation is considered in
                 which the robot is a point automaton operating in an
                 environment with unknown obstacles of arbitrary
                 shapes. The robot's input information includes its own
                 and the target-points coordinates as well as local
                 sensing information such as that from stereo vision or
                 a range finder. These algorithmic issues are
                 addressed: (1) Is it possible to combine sensing and
                 planning functions to produce `active sensing' guided
                 by the needs of planning? (The answer is yes). (2) Can
                 richer sensing (e.g., stereo vision versus tactile)
                 guarantee better performance, that is, resulting in
                 shorter paths? (The general answer is no). A paradigm
                 for combining range data with motion planning is
                 presented. It turns out that extensive modifications
                 of simpler tactile algorithms are needed to take full
                 advantage of additional sensing capabilities. Two
                 algorithms that guarantee convergence and exhibit
                 different styles of behavior are described, and their
                 performance is demonstrated in simulated examples.},

                 before they can be put in an assembly. The results
                 presented in this paper are a component of the
                 automated design of parts orienting devices. The focus
                 is on orienting parts with minimal sensing and
                 manipulation. We present a new approach to parts
                 orienting through the manipulation of pose
                 distributions. Through dynamic simulation we can
                 determine the pose distribution for an object being
                 dropped from an arbitrary height on an arbitrary
                 surface. By varying the drop height and the shape of
                 the support surface we can find the initial conditions
                 that will result in a pose distribution with minimal
                 entropy. We are trying to uniquely orient a part with
                 high probability just by varying the initial
                 conditions. We will derive a condition on the pose and
                 velocity of a simple planar object in contact with a
                 sloped surface that will allow us to quickly determine
                 the final resting configuration of the object. This
                 condition can then be used to quickly compute the pose
                 distribution. We also present simulation and
                 experimental results that show how dynamic simulation
                 can be used to find optimal shapes and drop heights
                 for a given part.},

                 feeding and alignment processes, and to provide energy
                 to encourage mobility among self-assembling parts. We
                 are studying a simple model of agitation where planar
                 parts are repetitively thrown by a simple
                 one-degree-of-freedom throwing surface, caught and
                 allowed to settle. Throwing actions result in
                 nonlinear discrete-time maps in the parts'
                 configuration space, exhibiting behaviors such as
                 unique fixed points and uncertainty-reducing forward
                 limit sets with large basins of attraction. We show
                 how to shape these maps by choosing the arm geometry,
                 throwing velocity and mass parameters of the parts. In
                 some cases, we can design a single map that is
                 guaranteed to uniquely position and orient a part. In
                 other cases, we can design multiple maps corresponding
                 to different throw velocities such that the
                 composition of the maps can be used to drive multiple
                 parts to a desired assembly. Switching between the
                 throw actions is triggered by simple sensors that
                 recognize when the system has achieved a configuration
                 in the basin of attraction of a subsequent map.},

                 The robot, whose configuration is composed of its
                 position and orientation, moves in a fully-known
                 environment by alternating rotations and forward
                 translations. We pose the problem as a discrete-time
                 planning problem in the robot's information space,
                 which encapsulates the uncertainty in the robot's
                 configuration. Our contribution is to show that in any
                 simply-connected, bounded polygonal environment,
                 localization by odometry alone is possible, but only
                 up to the symmetries in the environment.}

                 sensors and actuators with which the robot is
                 equipped. Our goal is to understand the relative power

                 determine which of these sets enable the robot to
                 complete its task. We define robots as collections of

                 comparing the sensing and actuation power of robots
                 constructed from these primitives. This comparison,

                 community that develop a theory, similar in spirit to
                 the theory of computation, for analyzing sensor-based
                 agent systems. The central element to this work is a
                 notion of dominance of one such system over another.
                 This relation is formally based on the agents'
                 progression through a derived information space, but
                 may informally be understood as describing one agent's
                 ability to ``simulate'' another. We present some basic
                 properties of this dominance relation and demonstrate
                 its usefulness by applying it to a basic problem in
                 robotics. We argue that this work is of interest to a
                 broad audience of artificial intelligence researchers
                 for two main reasons. First, it calls attention to the
                 possibility of studying belief spaces in way that
                 generalizes both probabilistic and nondeterministic
                 uncertainty models. Second, it provides a means for
                 evaluating the information that an agent is able to
                 acquire (via its sensors and via conformant actions),
                 independent of any optimality criterion and of the
                 task to be completed.}

                 models of time as a sequence of variable-length
                 discrete stages, rather than as a continuum. In this
                 paper, we substantially improve upon that earlier work
                 by addressing these problems.}

                 the robots into goal regions with specified velocities
                 using external control forces. The robots have
                 nonlinear dynamics, which may arise from the robot
                 body dynamics, friction between robot and environment,
                 and friction between robot and robot. Nonpenetration
                 constraints between robots are imposed, and the robots
                 are assumed rigid. The problem is modeled as a
                 mathematical program with complementarity constraints
                 (MPCC). The MPCC model is solved by using its elastic
                 mode, which is a well-behaved nonlinear programming
                 problem. Preliminary results with this approach are
                 illustrated on example problems. The main
                 contributions of this paper are a novel optimal
                 control model that can deal with friction in the
                 multiple robot system, and application of a new
                 mathematical programming algorithm to solve the MPCC
                 formulation. This optimal control model has potential
                 applications in robot systems with friction, such as
                 multifinger manipulation, manipulation with ropes, and
                 multi-robot pushing coordination.}

                 pursuit-evasion problem. We take a minimalist approach
                 in modeling the capabilities of a pursuer robot. A
                 point pursuer moves in an unknown, simplyconnected,
                 piecewise-smooth planar environment, and is given the
                 task of locating any unpredictable, moving evaders
                 that have unbounded speed. The evaders are assumed to
                 be points that move continuously. To solve the
                 problem, the pursuer must for each target have an
                 unobstructed view of it at some time during execution.
                 The pursuer is equipped with a range sensor that
                 measures the direction of depth discontinuities, but
                 cannot provide precise depth measurements. All pursuer
                 control is specified either in terms of this sensor or
                 wall-following movements. The pursuer does not have
                 localization capability or perfect control. We present
                 a complete algorithm that enables the limited pursuer
                 to clear the same environments that a pursuer with a
                 complete map, perfect localization, and perfect
                 control can clear (under certain general position
                 assumptions). Theoretical guarantees that the evaders
                 will be found are provided. The resulting algorithm to
                 compute this strategy has been implemented in
                 simulation. Results are shown for several examples.
                 The approach is efficient and simple enough to be
                 useful towards the development of real robot systems
                 that perform visual searching.},

                 an algorithm for a mobile robot to actively explore
                 the environment in order to achieve global
                 localization. During the localization process
                 interesting regions for future exploration are
                 selected based on the detected features and on the
                 hypotheses generated by the localization algorithm.
                 The localization process is improved by presenting
                 unique features to the robot's sensors. The proposed
                 algorithm provides highly robust global localization
                 in real world environments with very low computational
                 effort spent in finding exploration goal points.
                 Experimental results are given demonstrating the

                 mechanisms to coordinate the activities of multiple
                 autonomous agents. The need for coordination arises
                 because agents have to share resources and expertise
                 required to achieve their goals. Previous work in the
                 area includes using sophisticated information exchange
                 protocols, investigating heuristics for negotiation,
                 and developing formal models of possibilities of
                 conflict and cooperation among agent interests. In
                 order to handle the changing requirements of
                 continuous and dynamic environments, we propose
                 learning as a means to provide additional
                 possibilities for effective coordination. We use
                 reinforcement learning techniques on a block pushing
                 problem to show that agents can learn complimentary
                 policies to follow a desired path without any

                 planning focus on kinematic and geometric issues and
                 ignore the system dynamics. Those few that address
                 dynamics do so in a two-stage fashion by considering
                 one issue at the time. This work attempts to
                 incorporate control of body dynamics into the
                 sensor-based motion planning process. A point mobile
                 robot is assumed to operate in a planar environment
                 with unknown arbitrary stationary obstacles. Based on
                 its current velocity and sensory data about the
                 surrounding obstacles, the robot plans its motion to
                 locally maximize the turning angle toward the current
                 intermediate target. An optimal braking procedure
                 takes care of sudden potential collisions by
                 guaranteeing a safe emergency stopping path. Given the
                 constraints on robot's dynamics, sensing, and control
                 means, conditions are formulated for generating
                 trajectories that guarantee convergence and the
                 robot's safety at all times. The approach calls for
                 continuous computation and is fast enough for
                 real-time implementation. Simulated examples
                 demonstrate its performance.},

                 mapping of an unknown environment by multiple robots.
                 The mapping algorithm is an on-line approach to
                 likelihood maximization that uses hill climbing to
                 find maps that are maximally consistent with sensor
                 data and odometry. The exploration algorithm
                 explicitly coordinates the robots. It tries to
                 maximize overall utility by minimizing the potential
                 for overlap in information gain amongst the various
                 robots. For both the exploration and mapping
                 algorithms, most of the computations are distributed.
                 The techniques have been tested extensively in
                 real-world trials and simulations. The results
                 demonstrate the performance improvements and
                 robustness that accrue from our multi-robot approach
                 to exploration.},

                 an unknown environment with a team of mobile robots.
                 One of the key issues in multi-robot exploration is
                 how to assign target locations to the individual
                 robots. To better distribute the robots over the
                 environment and to avoid redundant work, we take into
                 account the type of place a potential target is
                 located in (e.g., a corridor or a room). To determine
                 the type of a place, we apply a classifier learned
                 with AdaBoost which additionally considers spatial
                 dependencies between nearby locations. Our approach to
                 incorporate the type of places in the coordination of
                 the robots has been implemented and tested in
                 different environments. The experiments demonstrate
                 that our system effectively distributes the robots
                 over the environment and allows them to accomplish
                 their mission faster compared to approaches that
                 ignore the semantic place labels.}

                 outdoor environment, staying close to a path is
                 crucial to successfully reaching its goal. Although
                 the degree of accuracy with which it estimates its own
                 location affects its ability to stay on the path,
                 accuracy in estimate of lateral distance from the path
                 is far more important for successful navigation than
                 accuracy in estimate of position along the path.
                 Utilizing methods based only on relative angular
                 measurements between landmarks in the environment, we
                 draw from techniques used in statistical pattern
                 recognition to show how landmarks can be chosen for
                 localization which will not only give good estimate of
                 location in spite of the measurement error, but will
                 also keep the robot on the path. We demonstrate how
                 identical landmark configurations can produce very
                 different results in localizing to a path and show how
                 simple heuristics can be used to choose the best
                 configuration for path localization.}

  abstract     = {Failures in mobile robot navigation are often caused
                 by errors in localizing the robot relative to its
                 environment. This paper explores the idea that these
                 errors can be considerably reduced by planning paths
                 taking the robot through positions where pertinent
                 features of the environment can be sensed. It
                 introduces the notion of a “sensory uncertainty
                 field” (SUF). For every possible robot configuration
                 q, this field estimates the distribution of possible
                 errors in the robot configuration that would be
                 computed by a localization function matching the data
                 given by the sensors against an environment model, if
                 the robot was at q. A planner is proposed which uses a
                 precomputed SUF to generate paths that minimize
                 expected errors or any other criterion combining, say,
                 path length and errors. This paper describes in detail
                 the computation of a specific SUF for a mobile robot
                 equipped with a classical line-striping camera/laser
                 range sensor. It presents an implemented SUF-based
                 motion planner for this robot and shows paths
                 generated by this planner. Navigation experiments were
                 conducted with mobile robots using paths generated by
                 the SUF-based planner and other paths. The former
                 paths were tracked with greater precision than the
                 others. The final section of the paper discusses
                 additional research issues related to SUF-based
                 planning.}

                 When multiple mobile robots are expected to cooperate,
                 they should work together towards a common goal
                 without interfering with each other physically. There
                 are many issues about the environment, goals, and
                 robot architecture that need to be addressed before
                 efficient coordination can be achieved. Dynamic,
                 hostile environments require robust coordination

                 be inconsistent on an inaccurate map, the method
                 represents the robot pose in a local frame attached to

                 robotics. Often, sensor limitations prevent accurate
                 state estimation of the robot. To solve robotics tasks
                 given such sensing uncertainty two general approaches
                 are usually taken. The first approach is to estimate
                 the state first and to solve the given task next using
                 the estimated state information. Hovewer, estimation
                 of the state may sometimes be harder than solving the
                 original task. The other approach is to avoid
                 estimating of the state, solving the task based only
                 on sensor information that comes to robot. These
                 approaches can be further generalized, by defining the
                 information space, the space of all the histories of
                 actions and sensors of the robot. All possible
                 solutions to the given task lie in this space,
                 including the solutions given by the above two
                 approaches. Considering information spaces brings
                 better understanding of the problems involving
                 uncertainty, and also allows finding better solutions
                 to such problems.}

                 robots were equipped with wireless communication for
                 the first time this year. We developed an approach for
                 sharing sensed information and effective coordination
                 through the introduction of shared potential fields.
                 The potential fields were based on the positions of
                 the other robots on the team and the ball. The robots
                 positioned themselves on the field by following the
                 gradient to a minimum of the potential field. In

                 robot teams based on considering how control
                 difficulty for different tasks grows with increases in
                 team size. Our analysis suggests that assignments of
                 persons to commander (single commands to entire robot
                 team), operator (commands to individual robots), and
                 coordinator (control of interdependent robots) roles
                 can lead to the most efficient organization. The
                 ability to assign tasks within or between operators
                 makes scheduling these interactions an important
                 factor in team performance. Two possible ways to
                 organize operators are through Individual Assignments
                 of robots or as a Call Center in which operators
                 service robots from the population as needed. In
                 recent experiments we have found that participants
                 performing an Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) foraging
                 task using waypoint control were at or over their
                 limits when controlling 12 robots. The present study
                 uses the same robots, environment, and level of
                 autonomy but with teams of two operators assigned to
                 control 24 robots. These operators controlled teams of
                 12 robots in the Individual Assignment condition. In
                 the Call Center condition operators shared control of
                 the 24 robots. For this task and level of robot
                 autonomy Individual Assignment participants performed
                 marginally better searching larger regions but without
                 finding more victims.}

  abstract     = {A technique for coordinating the paths of multiple
                 robots in the presence of obstacles is presented. To
                 accomplish this, the robots are prioritized. A path
                 that avoids only the stationary obstacles is planned
                 for the highest-priority robot. A trajectory for the
                 next-lowest priority robot is planned so that it
                 avoids both the stationary obstacles and the
                 higher-priority robot, which is treated as a moving
                 obstacle. This process is continued until trajectories
                 for all of the robots have been planned. The planning
                 is accomplished by first mapping the real space of the
                 robots into configuration-space-time. Potential fields
                 are applied around the c-space-time obstacles and are
                 used to modify the path of the robot. The advantage of
                 using artificial potential fields is that they offer a
                 relatively fast and efficient way to solve for safe
                 trajectories around both stationary and moving
                 obstacles. In the method used to perform path
                 planning, a trial path through the c-span-time is
                 chosen and then modified under the influence of the
                 potential fields until an appropriate path is found.},

	evasion problem in which bounds on the speeds of the pursuer and evader are
	given. In this setting, the pursuer tries to find the evader inside a simply
	connected polygonal environment, and the evader in turn tries to avoid
	detection. The focus of the paper is to develop a characterization of the set
	of possible evader positions as a function of time (the reachable sets). This
	characterization is more complex than the unbounded-speed case, because it no
	longer depends only on the combinatorial changes in the visibility region of
	the pursuer. The characterization presented can be used as a filter to keep
	track of the possible evader's position as a pursuer moves in the
	environment, or it can be used to guide the construction of the pursuer
	search strategy. This search algorithm is at least as powerful as a complete
	algorithm for the unbounded-speed case, and with the knowledge of speed
	bounds, generates solutions for environments that were unsolvable previously.
	Given that numerical methods are needed to compute the reachable sets, we
	also present a conservative approximation which can be computed with a closed
	formula.}
